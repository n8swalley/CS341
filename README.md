# CS341 - Advanced Data Structures

This course explored the implementation and use of the Object-Oriented (OO) Programming Paradigm and Advanced Data Structures in the C++ programming language. We learned GIT and used revision control in order to manage our code. These projescts explored advanced memory management techniques (heap and stack) and focused on the use of pointers (including pointer arithmetic). Specifically, we explored Advanced Data Structures including linked lists, hash tables, binary search and trees.
